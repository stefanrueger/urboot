# How to select a bootloader

It is tempting to go for the most feature-rich bootloader that
there is. However, consider carefully what you need:
 - **`pgm_write_page(sram, flash)`** for the application at `FLASHEND-4+1` is a necessary feature
   for applications that want to use MCU flash behind the code as storage in a similar fashion to
   EEPROM. It has security implications, but no more than generally having a bootloader on the
   chip.
 - **EPROM** access is generally thought of as useful. Applications can read initialisation
   parameters from EEPROM and store results there in the safe knowledge that the bootloader gives
   the user independent access to EEPROM.
 - **Protocol `u` or `s`.** Bootloaders with the `s` bit implement a skeleton STK500 protocol; they
   can normally also be programmed using `avrdude -c arduino`; the `s` protocol does *not* increase
   functionality but costs *a lot* of bootloader code space; they are only recommended when no
   recent version of avrdude with `-c urclock` programmer is available. The general recommendation
   is to always use bootloaders with the `u` urprotocol bit set. They are the *native* bootloaders
   for `-c urclock`. Once newer avrdude versions with `-c urclock` are widely available the `s`
   protocol is likely to be deprecated improving the clarity of the urboot.c source.
 - **Dual boot.** If there is no plan for over-the-air programming, and no external SPI flash on
   your board either, there is little benefit of using a dual-boot bootloader. Whilst they deal
   gracefully with a board that has no external SPI flash memory, they will add a little delay at
   each external reset or WDT reset. Also they toggle the SPI and chip select lines at each reset,
   which is something that not all projects can handle.
 - **Vector bootloaders or not**. This question only arises on parts that have hardware support,
   otherwise it has got to be a vector bootloader. In general, modern AVR parts with a universal
   programming and debug interface would not use (or implement) vector bootloaders. Other than that
   vector bootloaders normally occupy a multiple of the device's flash memory page size. In
   contrast to this, hardware-supported bootloaders often have very large sizes, eg, the ATmega328p
   can have hw-supported bootloaders with 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes size. Its flash page size
   is 128 bytes, so vector bootloaders can occupy any multiple of that.<p>Normally, the best use of
   MCU flash space is to select `j`-type vector bootloaders (see below), and only select `h`-type
   hardware supported bootloaders if they happen to occupy the same space. If, however, the
   bootloader is used for firmware updates on products where the MCU is not accessible otherwise,
   vector bootloaders have the disadvantage that they can brick in very rare cases, eg, if
   interrupted during upload at a sensitive spot, eg, by Vcc dipping just below the brownout
   detection whilst the MCU uses slightly more power during flash write of the first page that
   contains the reset vector.<p> Either way, when installing bootloaders take care to program the
   right fuses (see *Usage* in
   [readme](https://github.com/stefanrueger/urboot/blob/main/README.md)). There are three types of
   vector bootloaders that the urboot project offers:
    + `j` versions cost minimal to no extra space in the bootloader and need applications to be
      patched during upload. `avrdude -c urclock` does that auto-magically.
    + In `v` and `V` versions the bootloader patched the applications itself to various degrees of
      rigour. They generally consume a lot of extra space on the MCU at no run-time benefit; these
      types are not recommended, and urboot support for these are likely to be withdrawn in future.
 - **Protection** from overwriting itself and protection of the reset vector in vector bootloaders.
   All urboot bootloaders are protected from overwriting themselves, and this protection can no
   longer be switched off at compile time even when using hardware-supported bootloaders that could
   in theory also be protected by lock bits (as the user may have chosen not to program the lock
   bits). Vector bootloaders have an Achilles' heel in that the reset vector needs to always point
   to the bootloader. It is recommended the bootloader be compiled with `-DPROTECTRESET=1` or, if
   using `make` to supply `PROTECTRESET=1` on the make command line. If there is code space left
   then `urboot.c` automatically switches on this protection. Vector bootloaders with reset vector
   protection show a captial `P` in their features (hardware bootloaders don't need that). Not all
   is lost if the reset vector is unprotected in the bootloader: the `-c urclock` bootloader does
   not normally allow the reset vector to be overwritten during upload, and the `-c urclock -t`
   terminal also protects the reset vector of vector bootloaders. Self-modifying applications
   calling `pgm_write_page(sram, 0)` can overwrite the reset vector, though, unless the bootloader
   has reset vector protection. If that happens, the bootloader needs to be re-flashed.
 - **Autobaud.** If you have a fixed workflow where you can control the host baud rate, then the
   extra 16 bytes for autobaud detection may not be worth your while: vector bootloaders have to
   have a size of a multiple of the memory page size. If, by reducing the features of the
   bootloader, one can save a memory page for the bootloader that memory page is then available for
   *every* application that you may want to upload.
 - **Chip erase** in the bootloader is only of benefit on MCUs with large flash. If the bootloader
   does not offer chip erase `avrdude -c urclock` erases flash during upload of a new application
   by filling unused flash with 0xff; the extra time needed is hardly noticeable on small devices up
   to 8k flash making chip erase in the bootloader itself undesirable here.
 - **LED.** The same goes for the six additional code bytes spent for LED toggling. The novelty of
   the bootloader blinking during upload/download wears quickly off, and projects can not normally
   re-purpose the LED line without it being used as output during external reset.
 - **Template bootloaders.** Pre-compiled bootloaders labelled `_lednop` or `_template` contain nops
   as placeholders so that just before flashing them, another program can replace the nops with
   code to plug the right LED line and/or CS line needed for dual boot. They normally occupy the
   same space as bootloaders that are compiled for a specific LED and/or CS line, but can be
   slightly bigger, particularly when the LED and CS line are known to sit on the same port.
 - **Frills.** The label `_fr` indicated the presence of code that is not necessary for the working
   of the bootloader, for example that the application is started sooner after upload, or that frame
   errors in the serial communication get the bootloader to exit quickly. It is OK not to have these
   frills, particlarly when it means an extra memory page for *every* application.
