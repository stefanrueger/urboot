Acknowledgements. At some point in 2016 this project took optiboot as a
basis and rewrote it over the years in the quest for functionality,
reliability and, most importantly, space savings. Like the ship of Theseus
it has had virtually all of its original constructs replaced. It is fair
to say that without optiboot, and in particular Bill Westfield's work,
this project would never have happened. Therefore the acknowledgements
from 2016's optiboot are carried over:
